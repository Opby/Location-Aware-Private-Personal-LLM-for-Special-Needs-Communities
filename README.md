# Location-Aware-Private-Personal-LLM-for-Special-Needs-Communities
* A Personal Assistant prototype to demonstrate that a LLM hosted on a local device can be used to provide personalized instructions for special needs with accurate location detection powered by UWB proactively:
All user data can stay on local devices for privacy protection: Prove the hypothesis that a small LLM model with 2B parameters can be deployed and run on a typical local device with acceptable latency.
Fine tuned smaller LLB can achieve similar quality as larger LLMs for specific tasks: Fine tuned 2B LLM can provide personalized pace, length of sentences and structure to better serve special needs communities. 
UWB can be used to proactively trigger conversation with a user based location: Implement an end-to-end UWB triggered workflow sending prompts to the LLM to guide the user for routine daily tasks.
